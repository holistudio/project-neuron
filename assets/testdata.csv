Our Spaces Become Participants - Frog Design Tech Trends 2017,,,Link ,https://www.frogdesign.com/techtrends2017,,design principles,"design principles, healthcare, hospital"," Spaces will no longer simply house and support your activities   they will participate. More and more, the built environment will be a system of evolution and learning, integrating with architectural aesthetics and the utilitarian function of protecting you from the elements. Enabled by the proliferation of low-cost sensors, which can be easily embedded into an environment, machine learning will be used to identify usage patterns and recommend the reconfiguration of a space to drive new behaviors in healthcare, retail, research, manufacturing, work and residential spaces. Here is an example of how a scenario could play out in healthcare: hospitals will shift room layouts, update signage, and adapt lighting and sound to optimize individual patient experiences. These will be tailored to patients  current stress levels, severity and type of conditions, schedules, as well as personal lifestyle and fitness data. As these spaces learn and evolve, their impact will lead to both better health outcomes for patients, as well as lowering costs for hospitals. By Chad Lundberg & Jud Holliday ",,,,,,,,
How Tesla Will Change the World,Tim Urban,,Link,http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html,,design principles,"design principles, technology"," The way technology works is that by default, it stands still, and it moves forward only when something pushes it forward So if we re trying to figure out what makes technology move and change, we have to look at two sources of pressure: natural market conditions that ebb and flow and apply continual new pressures on all the actors within, and the  god  on top who can artificially change the environment below to create manufactured pressures.  - Tim Urban",,,,,,,,
How (and Why) SpaceX Will Colonize Mars ,Tim Urban,,Link,http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/how-and-why-spacex-will-colonize-mars.html/3,,design principles,design principles," We mentioned SpaceX s vertical integration and the full control it affords Musk over what happens at SpaceX, but Musk also believes the vertical structure is critical to keeping costs down, and he criticizes the rest of the industry for not doing so:  There s this tendency of big aerospace companies to outsource everything   They outsource to subcontractors, and then the subcontractors outsource to sub-subcontractors, and so on. You have to go four or five layers down to find somebody actually doing something useful actually cutting metal, shaping atoms. Every level above that tacks on profit it s overhead to the fifth power.   For architecture to be adaptive it has be an integrated process. Less overhead means the design costs less to the client. The integration also allows designers to recognize whole system optimization rather than marginal improvements to specific parts. ",,,,,,,,

Does the Internet of Things Have a History?,Molly Wright Steenson,,Link,https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2163252/Steenson_NG7.pdf,,design principles,design principles," Perhaps it is not so smart after all. Our fine-grained details become coarse when they meet big data, when decision technologies that respond to this data become embedded in the world around us. To return to John von Neumann s characterization, computer architectures organize the logical elements of the machine the architecture machine. We find that uniting the user with the machine creates sticky problems and that users still do not fare well. From inside the architecture machine - as designed by the architects of the smart city or the Internet of Things - there is no exit. ",,,,,,,,

Heat of the Moment,,,Link,https://www.architects.org/architectureboston/articles/heat-moment,,design principles,design principles,"Michelle Addington: You have to deal with moisture. You have to have a certain amount of fresh air and actually allow your building to breathe. I would never live in an insulated house. This house isn t, which is one reason I chose it. I replaced certain windows but   there s a leaky, or partially open, window in every room, all year  round. Lian Chang: And that gives you enough ventilation? Michelle Addington: Yes. Once you have that as a baseline, there s always a low-level heat, so I keep the house heated to 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Everything else is done by radiant temperature, by understanding the positioning of my body near what a cold sink would be? ?a cold sink being a window. It s a question of moving your body around in relationship to those things. Lian Chang: Not being too close to it   Michelle Addington: In the wintertime. I put up a shade system? ?just a regular paper shade; it doesn t have to be insulated. A piece of paper would stop losing radiant heat. One can do it vernacularly by understanding   that the important part to position is actually this part [gestures]. Lian Chang: That s the neck and chest? Michelle Addington: As long as that s somewhere near a heat source. If you have an LED television, that s actually a fantastic radiant heat source. Michelle Addington: Not only do we create heat, but we don t behave properly. Rudolph Hall [at Yale] underwent an extensive renovation five years ago. They eliminated operable windows because they were putting in a state-of-the-art HVAC system but couldn t afford override controls to prevent people from opening windows. There s this idea that to make the system work properly, you have to control people s behavior, that people are the problem as to why buildings don t perform better. Instead of trying to deal with smart glazing, why not invent one tiny panel where the smartness would be in how it directs heat radiation at neck level? That would be discrete and strategic. Lian Chang: And that might create different experiences within a building. Michelle Addington: I like to think of it as creating sensual pleasure. What the body needs for health is minimal: we need a certain amount of fresh air; temperatures not too hot or below freezing. So the rest of it is in dealing with definitions of comfort and determinations of thermal pleasure. Our entire HVAC systems are designed as if both are one and the same, but comfort is actually very local in terms of parts of the body, whereas health is the part that depends upon dilution. You need the dilution for health, but you don t need it for comfort, so separate the two. Smart Technology Is Making Us Dumb",,,Link,http://www.intelligencesquaredus.org/debates/smart-technology-making-us-dumb,,design principles,design principles,"Smart tech has increased public access to information, but this has not necessarily increased a person s knowledge. It has amplified the negative aspects of democracy. The danger is that smart technology is taking away time for deep think and ultimately makes us more complacent: we end up expecting a lot more things done automatically for us. Certain things are human responsibilities that shouldn t be devolved to automation. Knowledge is asking questions, as emphasized by Andrew Keen. Nicholas Carr, when pressed to give a recommendation on how to use smart technology, simply replied  use less of it  Genevieve Bell highlights a lot of assumptions hidden in the statement. It implies that certain actions are dumber than others when in fact those actions can be important or key to improving quality of life. Anxiety is also implied by the statement. Those worries may be warranted but let s not throw the baby out with the bathwater. Technology at its best is assistive. What does this imply for intelligent adaptive buildings?: I feel every person is smart is some ways and dumb in others. Technology can magnify both parts of each person. The people for the motion provide very good warnings for each of us to pay attention to. If we listen them, including using less tech, we may be able to strike a good balance, one where we use tech just enough to make sure Bell and Weinberger s positive views are still valid. Using less of technology doesn t preclude using technology in more interesting ways. Surely there must be a way to focus our attention to the assistive aspects of smart tech. In general, when we discuss innovative technology in buildings, we have to constantly asking ourselves: why do we need this? Am I dependent on this in some way? Am I in control of that dependency? Am I thinking more or less with this piece of tech?"
IDEO s Tim Brown on Using Design to Change Behavior,,,Link,https://hbr.org/2010/03/design-to-change-behavior-tips,,design principles,design principles,"Create simple, new digital tools to provide feedback.  Think of the iPhone app Lose It, which allows mobile tracking of food intake,  Brown says.  Or Google s PowerMeter , which encourages communities to share energy-use data.  (Neither is an Ideo project.). Smartphone apps and Web-based software are inexpensive to create and deploy. Keep in mind, however, that such tools are only as good as the information they channel. With regard to Lose It, for example, Brown notes that it  will only be successful if better data is available around the health characteristics of food, such as in New York where restaurants have to post the calorie count of their meals.  Invent for the future consumer, not the present customer. This can be hard to do, as consumer research tends to focus on buying habits today. Brown suggests that future desires might be best foreseen via playful brainstorming that s slightly structured. Offer a design team, for example, some jumping off points to fuel their imagination, rather than simply ask  what will customers want ten years from now?  He offers a recent example from IDEO.  For our climate-change website, Livingclimatechange.com, we have created scenarios that describe the kinds of innovations that might be necessary to achieve our [current] carbon reduction goals,  Brown says.  But we re also inviting designers to contribute additional scenarios to also focus the conversation less on what we will have to give up and more on what we will create.  Rather than asking only how to provide ways to prompt people to cut energy usage by providing tools that can help them modify existing habits   an obvious goal   IDEO is asking its team to think of radical new fuel-saving products, too. Be patient with monitoring  success.  Mass behavior doesn t change overnight. Sales and other metrics shouldn t be used alone to judge immediate innovation results. Again, he offers an example from IDEO: Health Buddy, an at-home patient-monitoring system the firm created for Health Hero Network   created more than a decade ago.  Recently [when presented in a June 2009 study], the VA found a 60% drop in hospital admissions from 2003-2007. The thesis is that by asking patients about the state of their condition every day through a [device with a] very simple interface, the patient is more likely to do important things like check weight, take medication,  Brown says.  And this constant monitoring allows physicians to catch issues much earlier.  IDEO didn t expect such dramatic results over 3 months or a year. But waiting for positive results after years of trials, the number was clearly impressive over time.",,,,,,,,

Sensors can possibly notice changes in occupant behavioral patterns and designers can know when to may intervene.

How does behaviour really affect energy use?,Arup,,Link,http://thoughts.arup.com/post/details/505/how-does-behaviour-really-affect-energy-use,,design principles,design principles,"Summary: Stochastic modeling is called for as the next step in capturing the random-but-somewhat-predictable behavior of building occupants. Annex 66 of the International Energy Agency s Energy in Buildings and Community Programme is looking into this. A crucial part of this is to measure occupant behavior currently in building. Coming up with a robust modeling method comes later. Take Away: This is a really good start to understanding how buildings perform after they are built. But why stop there? Why not also look at ways to drive occupant behavior? While previous topics have pointed out the dangers of how building systems could impose and influence people without them knowing, we still should remember that the interaction between people and building systems is not a one way street.",,,,,,,,

Usability and Software Architecture,,,Link,http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bej/usa/index.html,,design principles,design principles,"The usability analyses or user test data are in; the development team is poised to respond. The software had been carefully modularized so that modifications to the UI would be fast and easy. When the usability problems are presented, someone around the table exclaims,  Oh, no, we can t change THAT!  The requested modification or feature reaches too far into the architecture of the system to allow economically viable and timely changes to be made. Even when the functionality is right, even when the UI is separated from that functionality, architectural decisions made early in development have precluded the implementation of a usable system. The members of the design team are frustrated and disappointed that despite their best efforts, despite following current best practice, they must ship a product that is far less useable than they know it could be. This scenario need not be played out if usability concerns are considered during the earliest design decisions of a system, that is, during the architectural design, just as concerns for performance, availability, security, modifiability, and other quality attributes are considered. The relationships between these attributes and architectural decisions are relatively well understood and taught routinely in software architecture courses. However, the prevailing wisdom in the last 20 years has been that usability had no architectural role except through modifiability; design the UI to be easily modified and usability will be realized through iterative design, analysis and testing. Separation of the user interface has been quite effective, and is commonly used in practice, but it has problems. First, there are many aspects of usability that require architectural support other than separation, and, second, the later changes are made to the system, the more expensive they are to achieve. Forcing usability to be achieved through modification means that time and budget pressures are likely to cut off iterations on the user interface and result in a system that is not as usable as possible. Recent research conducted jointly by the U&SA project at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute & Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University has investigated the relationship between architectural decisions and usability. This project gives usability specialists and software developers alike an explicit link between their two realms of expertise, allowing both to participate more effectively in the early design decisions of an interactive system. It gives the entire design team the tools to consider usability from the very earliest stages of design, and allow informed architectural decisions that do not preclude usability.",,,,,,,,

As it continues to grow quickly in profits and headcount, Google has decided it wants to devise new ways to make its headquarters expandable. The company has hired two architects, Thomas Heatherwick and Bjarke Ingels, who have come up with an idea that feels as though it was concocted at an all-night party at Burning Man, the annual gathering of hippies and techies in the Nevada desert. Their plan is to construct a mobile set of glass buildings that would expand and shift like Lego blocks as different departments  space requirements changed. A specially designed crane will be needed to rearrange the structures. The proposal suggests that Google, having disrupted many industries, now wants to rethink a central tenet of architecture: that buildings are immovable. ",,,,,,,,

Made with Cemesto wall system several room modules serviced by a  service core  to which all bathroom, kitchen, plumbing, and heating systems were attached. 1942 US Government needs to build a town over night for the Manhattan Project. Hired SOM for a flexible space design Post war - idea was developed further by companies like Gunnison and Lustron George Nelson  Psychologically, the good folk who inhabited these dwellings thought that they were beneath them. In other words, the deviation of the dwelling was not something to their liking.  Paul Rudolph on Oriental Masonic Gardens, a modular dwelling project. This could be a reason why American housing market values private single family homes, unlike Europe. See Klip House Summary: Modular construction has been around for a while. It has gained greater acceptance in Europe than in America, where people seem to desire more single family houses and zoning laws are more restrictive. What to take away: Modular housing will always face regulatory and market challenges. What remains to be seen is  modular housing that can change over time. Otherwise, modular housing is only marginally cheaper than conventional construction. But if needs change drastically and modular construction can respond to meet those needs more cheaply, then they could become more popular.",,,,,,,,
Prefab's Moment Of Reckoning,,,Link,https://www.fastcodesign.com/3066177/prefabs-moment-of-reckoning,,physical design,physical design,"461 Dean St development faced two disputes: one with plumbers who say that since only part of the work is done by licensed plumbers, it violates building codes; the other is a dispute between the developer and Skanska construction over cost overruns. It s now complete, two years behind schedule. ""It was only through looking at that pipeline of seeing how big the project is, that we could invest that energy and effort up front and spend what was frankly a lot of money just researching and figuring it out,"" says Adam Greene, vice president of residential development at FCRC. ""The building itself couldn t afford that R&D.""  Because of zoning, the facade has a number of setbacks, which resulted in 23 different apartment configurations.  Working with the engineering firm Arup, SHoP developed a brace frame system that secures the modules in place, which was the tower's big architectural innovation.  The modules themselves were made from steel frames, fabricated in Virginia, and fitted with facade panels that came from Minnesota. At a factory in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, the contractors then completely built out the interiors kitchens, bathrooms, closets, windows, etc. and then craned them into place. Only the floors for each apartment were installed on-site; everything else arrived complete. Doesn t all this outsourcing still add to costs? Was it not possible to get all the materials to one factory and then build it all into modular units before shipping to the construction? Skanska alleged that the design was flawed for example, the tolerances were so small that tiny errors compounded to cause alignment issues and that it could not guarantee its performance.FCRC counter-sued, saying that the builder did not have the right expertise to complete the job. Skanska terminated its contract with FCRC in September 2014. Eventually FCRC took over the prefab factory that had been built for the project in the Navy Yard, and began acting as both the developer and contractor. In October 2016, FCRC announced it had sold off the prefab factory to a new company called Full Stack Modular, founded by Roger Krulak formerly senior vice president of modular construction at FCRC effectively ending its involvement with the grand prefab experiment. Wow  The challenge with a modular building is that all of the building s major components, whether constructed in the field or the factory, must come together and be assembled at one location much like the frame and components of a car comes together for assembly on the factory floor. Workers on a factory floor should not be improvising or force fitting components. Accordingly, the designer of a modular building, like the designer of car, must not only consider how each component will be designed, but how all of the components will fit together and ultimately be assembled into one, integrated whole. As a result, the modular building designer has a much greater obligation than the designer of a conventional building that simply includes some prefabricated elements.  - statement from Skanska After 15 stories, extra brace framing is needed to support the building. Stay under that height, and the building's complexity is significantly less. ""So if you keep the building under 15 stories, there s a good case for that,"" Sharples says. ""When you re talking about the five boroughs, that s not a bad height to be chasing."" This is a very disruptive technology within a field that is very traditional. I think to really change the industry and the way people have been building, I think it's going to take a while, but we ve been having conversations with cities, other developers, and other construction companies who are very interested in what we re doing.  - Susi Yu Companies mentioned: http://www.capsyscorp.com/portfolio.php?c=14&p=4,http://gluckplus.com/project/the-stack What to take away: Skanska makes an excellent point. The process has to be well integrated to work. It s not enough to have disruptive technology if it s used in a traditional setup where designers and construction are uncoordinated. One wonders what would happen if everything really did happen under one roof, both design and construction.",,,,,,,,

The downside is the long-term impact on the growth of the city as it becomes increasingly uncompetitive. We are caught between high land prices and an inefficient industry that is working at capacity and we are imperilling our cities. To start to pull ourselves out of this hole we need to be able build on a massive scale, more quickly, more cheaply with new sources of labour and to be able to build the sort of homes and environments people want. These are the considerations that our system addresses. WHERE IS MODULAR HOUSING GOING WRONG? Traditional volumetric modular design works by stacking boxes on top of each other. This system is limiting in design form, resulting in an unvaried offering and unloved buildings. Many supposed benefits, such as speed of construction, are lost in transporting large volume, unwieldy structures to site, the finishing is often poor, it is not a solution that can be scaled to the problem and the flexibility offered is less than the market requires. RETHINKING THE MODULAR - A NEW BUILDING CONCEPT Design becomes fluid and free. Buildings built with this system need not look alike and a wide range of building configurations and finishes can easily be built on the same site. The system components are flat-packed modular, made off site without the need for specialised factories. Yet, this system delivers flexible slab structures, architecturally designed spaces and volumes, with high-end finishes, smooth routing of MEP and state-of-the-art acoustic and energy considerations. A SYSTEM THAT LEARNS AND GROWS With Rethinking the Modular, reliable design and precision engineering is combined with a learning computational system; where each new design is added to the library. Conventional construction is left behind as the BuroHappold system can be built dramatically faster with a workforce requiring more assembly than craft skill. The system works with a wide range of existing building components, especially facade, bathroom and kitchen systems. A NEW TECHNOLOGY - A NEW ANSWER Here is a technology that can address the supply bottlenecks in our existing housing system, give a product that is highly variable, and has a better energy performance. The possibilities for (distributed) industrialised mass production of the system provide the opportunity of a rapid decrease in component cost. It is quite capable of producing 100,000 homes a year for the London market. But it s more than that. Our new approach to prefabricated modular housing provides the design flexibility and sophistication that can help with how we create the  places  we need  places that are empathetic, are where we would want to live and bring up a family, and places that foster community, culture and employment. A FRESH START We re developing a unique engineering design system which can deliver modular housing: at scale and with less carbon up to 30% faster more economic, uses flat pack parts intrinsic design flexibility for individuality and architectural design expression sensitive to place making and community creation requiring less skilled construction labour a system that self learns, and grows a library of components with each project all parts can be manufactured locally We call it BuroHappold REMODULAR  Summary: Buro Happold is developing a modular housing system. What to take away: Adaptive architecture has to be able to  learn  and  grow.  This can only be achieved to the fullest with a flexible system of building parts.",,,,,,,,

These metrics include the following: Efficiency   Measurement of how well sites are performing against building comparables and against their own baselines.  Higher efficiency results in reduced operating costs. Comfort   Measurement of how well the site is maintaining setpoints.  The closer to setpoint each zone is for both heating and cooling, the more comfortable the site is.  Better comfort results in happier occupants leading to lower vacancy rates. Equipment Operations    Measurement of the operational health of the mechanical systems.  This takes into consideration failure rates, degradations in performance, and system wide issues that impact operation and equipment longevity. Network Health   Measurement of connected nodes, device status, data integrity and overall network performance.

Danish Architects at Aarhus,,,Link,http://www.archdaily.com/774376/how-danish-architects-connect-with-users-to-provide-them-with-the-best-architecture-possible,,interface,interface,"Architects: Aarhus Arkitekterne  In a situation like this, it is necessary to find a way to connect with patients who you don't know at all, and who have difficulty moving and understanding a space. The architects in charge of the project, Aarhus Arkitekterne, took this apparent disadvantage as an opportunity, accommodating the patient experience through technology and making it part of the treatment. Thus, a series of white rooms are transformed through lighting, sound and the projection of moving images, taking the patient to places he may never be able to visit in his life. This strategy is successful and allows for the effective treatment of a number of patients, but not everyone can afford it and it isn't scalable, since it requires a high monetary investment in order to be implemented and run over time. However, beyond the fact that these technologies are not yet available to everyone, flexibility and adaptability were key to complying with the project's goals and to ensuring that it functions properly.   To speed up the process and increase the level of response, the architects created cards with attractive, mock-up images of the park, that people could write their interests and ideas on. At the same time, they created a website and Facebook page that are kept updated to this day. The feedback they received paved the way to a successful project, which now receives visitors from all parts of the community.   Again, the users were consulted, but this time, using what is now a common practice in the office, a number of full scale models were made, which hospital officials could test out. The models were made of simple and easy to handle materials, to be re-configured in areas in situ, according to the feedback received.  In this case, as a starting point, the architects used a tool that the Municipal Council of the city has made ??available to all project implementers of public relevance: The Aarhus model for Citizen Involvement. This democratic instrument allowed the architects to gather the ideas and wishes of the residents as a collective intelligence, shaping a building that received more than 500,000 visitors in the first four months. Social networks are an important part of this reach, where the hashtag #Dokk1 has achieved great popularity, uniting the user experience through photography, videos and comments. Architects from AART, for example, have joined the Alexandra Institute, which specializes in anthropological studies of physical spaces, in order to carry out social surveys to document the social performance of its already completed buildings. The surveys follow a set of defined parameters and study variables related to the use (functions), comfort (indoor climate, lighting), aesthetics (materials, shapes, details), the relationship with the context (social, cultural and physical), social facilities (spaces of interaction), fluency (ease of movement, universal design) and the environment (relationship with the surroundings).",,,,,,,,

ASHRAE on Building Analytics,,,Link,https://www.ashrae.org/resources--publications/periodicals/enewsletters/ashrae-journal-newsletter/take-control-of-building-operations-using-analytics/,,interface,interface,"Take Control Of Building Operations Using Analytics Building automation systems generate vast amounts of data about how building systems perform. Taking all of that data and making it useful can be a challenge, but using analytics can avoid potential problems, reduce costs, and increase performance. A free ASHRAE webcast,  Take Control: Using Analytics to Drive Building Performance,  will delve into the benefits of analytics. The presenters discussed some of the aspects of analytics that they will explore in the webcast. Why have analytics become so crucial to building performance? Based on available information, many buildings consume up to 30% excess energy (beyond their original design expectation). Recently, many states and cities have passed benchmarking, disclosure, and  tune-up  mandates as part of their climate action plans. Therefore, many building owners are being compelled to make their buildings more energy efficient. Existing building improvements have traditionally been performed through existing building commissioning, which is perceived by many as costly and not ensuring persistence of energy savings over time. Real-time or near real-time building analytics can solve both of these issues by lowering the cost and continuously maintaining the building systems at peak efficiency. Another impetus for building analytics is the ease of access to  raw  data from the existing building automation systems and other data sources. Building analytics can also alleviate potential problems by integrating advanced energy systems such as photovoltaic, battery and thermal storage, electric vehicles, and other advanced building technologies. Building analytics (properly configured) can reduce energy consumption while improving occupant comfort. When using analytics to drive building performance, what is the most difficult barrier to overcome? Because analytics by nature requires access to data that can be converted to actionable information, not having easy access to data has been the most common barrier. Once the data access issues are solved, the next barrier to overcome is validation of data (e.g., how frequently should the data be collected, how to validate the sensor reading, what data should be collected). Finally, there is a need for validated algorithms that can be used to detect and diagnose operational problems or identify energy savings opportunities. Because it is unlikely that individual building owners are going to perform building analytics on their own, they will likely rely on third-party energy service providers who will need remote access to their building automation systems. This requires adherence to cybersecurity best practices, so the building s IT network and infrastructure is not compromised. Finally, analytics as it is deployed today can only identify opportunities. Unless these opportunities are acted upon, savings will not be realized. This requires building owners and building operators to be more proactive in implementing the identified corrective actions. What role does commissioning play in controls strategies and analytics? Building owners generally rely on existing building commissioners to validate the control strategies and to improve building performance. This approach is generally a one-time effort that requires periodic revisits to ensure the persistence of efficient and optimized building operations. Recently, existing building commissioning agents and energy services providers have come to rely heavily on building analytics to improve building operations. The building analytics process can be viewed as a  continuous  commissioning process, which ensures persistence of efficient and optimized building operations.",,,,,,,,

Website has an analytics section and manage the project s information.

Buildings can market that certification level through the 12 months while the points are dynamically varying throughout that year. SCore on display is based on a rolling average of 12 month data. Hence on display it updates every month. Score Making the LEED score public is an option, not required. If it is public, it is accessible through the LEED Dynamic Plaque App Analytics Can be accessible by building occupants depending on the project team choice Carbon factors from EPA E-Grid standard used to calculate Carbon Emissions Each category also has a slider tool that tell you how much energy/water reduction is necessary to reduce carbon emissions or increase score. FEEDBACK. Of course it s still not clear how reductions can be achieved, but that s up to the project team. Manage Apps Pricing For projects not LEED certified Pay registration fee, valid of five years If you then certify, you pay another one time fee Recertification is required every 12 months Questions How much of this is intended to make it easier to certify a project over its lifetime, and how much of this is intended for public awareness? Benchmarking more accessible This starts a conversation that is easier to follow. The score is somewhat dependent on performance of similar building types. The score is somewhat absolute. An energy score of 33 is only possible through net zero. This is just a platform. So the degree of public awareness will ultimately depend on the project, its design team, its budget. The first goal is just to get a massive number of buildings in the data base. But don t you have some imagined way that everyday people can access the data and learn about the building s sustainability features? What s the LEED Dynamic Plaque app? Is that for building occupants? Eventually yes. What the fuck is a monotone interpolating spline?

Public housing does not come with A/C. Tenants have to pay a yearly fee in addition to buying the A/C itself. Electricity is included in the rent for public housing tenants, so the air conditioning fee is meant to offset some the extra electricity the machines use. Some tenants resort to buying an A/C unit without reporting it to NYC Housing Authority. Prathap Ramamurthy, an assistant professor at the City College of New York, coordinates the data collection portion of the study using Arduino sensors. The hope is that the study will yield temperature data proving that overheated apartments are a public health risk. The Health Department estimates 140 New Yorkers died from excess heat in 2013. That s the same number of pedestrians in New York who were killed by cars that year. What to Take Away: The sensors are small and not very obstrusive. They are also getting less expensive to build, which means they can be used outside of  high end  building and construction. Smart technology isn t just for the rich.",,,,,,,,
